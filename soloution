Implementing AWS WAF for Web Application Protection

AWS Web Application Firewall :

WAF stands for Web Application Firewall. It is a security solution designed to protect web applications from various online threats and attacks. Web applications, which include websites, web services, and other online platforms, can be vulnerable to a range of attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the application code or take advantage of insecure configurations.
A Web Application Firewall acts as a barrier between a web application and the internet, monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between the two. Its primary purpose is to identify and block malicious traffic and attacks, while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through.

Steps 1:
Launch Ec2 instance and create launch template  configure the settings, including the (AMI), instance type, and storage.

step 2:
Connect instance and configure instance by following command :
 ==> "git clonehttps://lnkd.in/dM36RrEh"
==> install docker.io
==> sudo systemctl start docker
 ==> sudo systemctl enable docker
==> cd django-notes-app
==>sudo docker build -t note-app
==>sudo docker build . -t note-app
==> sudo docker run -d -p 8888:8000 note-app

step 3:
map 8888 to 8000



conclusion:
now our  web app is hosted sucessfully  just use public ip adress of machine from which you have hosted it. 
format of accessing site <ip adress:8888>
