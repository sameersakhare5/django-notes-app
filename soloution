Implementing AWS WAF for Web Application Protection

AWS Web Application Firewall :

WAF stands for Web Application Firewall. It is a security solution designed to protect web applications from various online threats and attacks. Web applications, which include websites, web services, and other online platforms, can be vulnerable to a range of attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in the application code or take advantage of insecure configurations.
A Web Application Firewall acts as a barrier between a web application and the internet, monitoring and filtering HTTP traffic between the two. Its primary purpose is to identify and block malicious traffic and attacks, while allowing legitimate traffic to pass through.

Steps 1:
Launch Ec2 instance and create launch template  configure the settings, including the (AMI), instance type, and storage.

step 2:
Connect instance and configure instance by following command :
 ==> "git clonehttps://lnkd.in/dM36RrEh"
==> install docker.io
==> sudo systemctl start docker
 ==> sudo systemctl enable docker
==> cd django-notes-app
==>sudo docker build -t note-app
==>sudo docker build . -t note-app
==> sudo docker run -d -p 8888:8000 note-app

step 3:
map 8888 to 8000

step 4:
 Using template create autoscaling group. Launch Template created earlier.
set up scaling policies, desired capacity, and other parameters.

step5:
In Ec2 dashboard navigate to load balancer and create load balancer 
-add instance to the target group

step 6:
In the AWS WAF console, go to WebACLs and click "Create WebACL."
Define the conditions for your WebACL, specifying the rules to allow or block requests.

step 7: 
test web-app
http://<Your_Load_Balancer_DNS_Name>:80

conclusion:
now our WAF for Web Application Protection implemented successfully.
